This task was almost easy.It really helped in understanding the basics of linux comands. The first 3 parts of this task was easy but the forth part was a bit tricky for me. 
I got the following passwords:-
part1=107 
part2=562 
part3=101 
part4=977 
So the final password was 107562101977 

There is a mistake in the password found by me as the pdf was not opening.
